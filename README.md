# Electric Tantra Repo

This is the repository that my very own Arch Linux repo exists within. Not even using S3 to store it anymore, with enough frustration, I have now gotten it functional as a package repo via free storage on Github. Pretty awesome, no need to pay 10 cents a month when its `free 99`.

## Packages

The packages here are all AUR packages or my own not released on AUR. The purpose is to enable me to grab these suckers when building the Electric Tantra Linux (hence the name, duh), which is my very own Arch-based linux distribution featuring my dotfiles.

I may also keep packages useful to have off of AUR, either due to lengthy downloads, personal modifications or to remember them for one reason or another that my dotfiles don't work well for, for whatever reason.

## TO DO

-   sign the packages and handle the key monkey business to make it secured.
-   Modify some of the packages a bit more
